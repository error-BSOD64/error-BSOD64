Hi! I am error-BSOD64 a.k.a. GodDuck. (On Discord)
A begginer developer whose main focus is on "repetitive task automation" and 
providing solutions for software managmement automation. (Ties in loosely, but it's diffetrent)
I always had an interest in Electronics, but never had the oppurtunity, so
i turned my hobbies to configuring servers and (the main focus of this repository) programming and developing software.
Here you'll find scripts and software for a variety of purposes that helped me a lot.
Keep in mind that i do this in my spare time, with no plans of dedicating full-time to this.
The way you can support me is reminding me of the work i've done. (For example: Downloading and using them as well as
sharing positive feedback with other people. Not me because aside from the fact that there's no messaging or social media profile links, 
just the fact that you, the user downloaded it and used it, shows proof that you care, and you caring is the best and only way of supporting! <3)

Have fun with the repos!

The best for you!
